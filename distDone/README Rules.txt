Rules:

1) Four Player Game

2) Each Person chooses a color(Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue). Each color has
3 different pieces

3) Each piece can only leave their "home base" if the player rolls a 6 or a 1.
If the player rolls a 6, the piece they chose to leave the home base can move again
with a different roll.

4)If a player's piece lands on a another piece, then the piece
landed on will "die" and be sent back to the home base.

4)If the piece gets all the way around the board without dying, then it will be 
automatically sent to a safe zone, where it can no longer be killed or moved.

5) The first player to get all 3 pieces around the board, and get all three pieces
into their safe zone will win.

6) If oyu get a 6 but use it on a piece outside the homebase, you don't get to role
again.

7)If a piece is in front of your starting position and you role a 6 or a 1, then
you won't be able to move out.
